In order to have robust specs for your code it is encouraged to follow these testing guidelines.

The most important thing it to ensure that specs:
1. Are able to be run quickly
2. Are robust so it doesn't break when implementation is changed
3. Are easily updated or changed
4. Have clear input and clear expected output
